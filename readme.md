# Todo List

Create a todo list app using HTML, JS, and the CSS file `todos.css` in this directory.  Your app should look and function like the following GIF:

### Getting started

 - You'll need to create a blank HTML page and JS File. 

 - Then link your JS File and the CSS File (todos.css) inside your HTML file
 (Hint: Look up script tag for JS, and google "how to link css file to html")

 - Either put your script tag all the way at the end of your HTML file or add the `defer` attribute [more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)

### Part One

* A user can hit enter in the text input to add a new todo
* A user can click on the "Add Todo" button to add a new todo
* Make sure the app looks just like the following gif.  Use the CSS to figure out what element types, classnames, and id's you may need to use.

### Part Two

* When a user clicks on an 'X' on a todo, it removes that todo item.
* When a user clicks on 'Edit' on a todo, it lets the user edit the todo item
